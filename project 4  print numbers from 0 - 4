//The setTimeout function works asynchronously, which means that it does not block the execution of the loop. Therefore, the loop completes all iterations before the first setTimeout function is executed.

In addition, the variable i is declared with the var keyword, which creates a variable in the global scope. This means that all setTimeout functions will reference the same variable i which will have a final value of 5 at the end of the loop.

//we can use for loop to print all of them! But we want them to print with a delay of n seconds where n is the current iteration for example in 1st iteration the delay is 0 seconds and in 2nd it’s 1 seconds and in 3rd it’s 2 seconds and so on..

for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  (function (j) {
    setTimeout(function () {
      console.log(j);
    }, j * 1000);
  })(i);
}
